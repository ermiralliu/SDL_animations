#SDL_animations

Some animations I made based on the Rain-Simulator.
This time trying to use more C++ features.
If you want to compile yourself, download the SDL2 folder from Rain-Simulator-cpp (or from the official page) and paste it into the folder.

Press "r" to choose the type of animation.

Press "i" to choose the rain initialization/placement.
